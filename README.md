### **imanai TAP service template project**

This repository provides the template project used for creating new services in the Imanai TAP platform.

**Prerequisites:**

- Git must be installed and available in your system’s PATH.

To create a new service, run the bootstrap script located in [imanai-tap.platform](https://github.com/komelgman/imanai-tap.platform/tree/main), specifying the desired service name. For example:

```shell
./bootstrap/new-service.sh my-new-service
```

The script will generate a fully initialized project based on this template.
After generation, follow the instructions in the newly created service’s README to complete the setup and continue development.
